# Procrastination Simulator
## Set-up
* Install Node.js
* Install dependencies
`npm i`

## Project Structure
* classes: our classes like Player, Personality, TimeManager etc.
* components: Reusable UI components like schedule Calendar, popups, bars/stats displays, etc.
* pages: Page-level components if you use React Router or want to distinguish major screens in your single-page app.
* context: If we use the Context API to store and manage game state (e.g., player stats), we can keep our providers here.
* utils: General helper functions that donâ€™t belong in any specific class.
